# CLOIR A Contrastive Learning approach to Object Influence Retrieval
This is the source code for the [paper "Influence beyond similarity: a Contrastive Learning approach to Object Influence Retrieval"](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-77792-9_3), published as a [EKAW](https://ekaw.org) conference paper.
We introduce an approach to suggest the existence of influence relations between objects, having access to information about influence between their agents. 
The main steps of the approach include (i) sourcing of influence relations between agents (ii) feature extraction to represent the objects (iii) training of a contrastive network with triplet loss (iv) retrieval of suggested influential objects and evaluation.

# Datasets
1. Wikiart: All images are taken from the [WikiArt Dataset (Refined)](https://github.com/cs-chan/ArtGAN/tree/master/WikiArt%20Dataset) github repo. The corresponding metadata has been scraped from [Wikiart](https://www.wikiart.org). The influence between artist have been retrieved via a scraping from WikiData and WikiArt exploiting the relation [Influenced by](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P737). 

2. [iDesigner](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/idesigner/data): We use the images contained in DATA/Dataset/iDesigner/designer_image_train_v2_cropped.

3. The retrieved influences between agents can be found in DATA/influence_dicts. The code to retrieve the agent influences from Wikidata can be found in get_influence_wikidata.py


 # CLOIR
 Data extraction and preparation - run the code only once

```
python get_influence_wikidata.py
python dataset_extracted_features.py
```
Steps of experiments are performed with different setups, varying: dataset, feature, train_split, sampling_strategy, num_example_sample

1. Data Loader
```
python create_data_loader.py --dataset_name "wikiart" --feature "$feature" --data_split "stratified_artists" --num_examples 100 --positive_based_on_similarity

```
2. Training model 

```
python Triplet_Network.py --dataset_name "wikiart" --feature "$feature" --data_split "stratified_artists" --num_examples 100 --positive_based_on_similarity

```

3. Evaluation
```
python evaluation.py --dataset_name "wikiart" --feature "$feature" --data_split "stratified_artists" --num_examples 100 --positive_based_on_similarity

```

abstract="Innovative art or fashion trends do not spring out of nowhere: they are products of societal contexts, movements and economic turning points. To understand the dynamics of innovation, it is necessary to understand influence relations between agents (e.g. artists, designers, creatives) and between the objects (e.g. clothes, paintings) that these agents produce. However, acquiring knowledge about these connections is challenging given that they are frequently undocumented. Recent literature has focused on discovering influence relations between agents, utilizing either object similarity or social network information. However, these methods often overlook the importance of direct relations between objects or oversimplify the complex nature of influence by approximating it with similarity.",
